# The Cloud Migration Playbook

So, you want to migrate your legacy, on-premises services to the cloud? Cloud migrations ("digital transformations") have a reputation - and, largely, it isn't positive. However, your experience doesn't have to be. This playbook covers getting to the cloud. The people. The process. And the technology.

## People

### The Culture That Produced The Problem Is Liable To Repeat The Failure

### Education

Should I train my people?  

#### Short-term Education Strategy

Beneficial in the short tem. Consult "Should I hire a different team?"

## Hiring

### Should I Hire A Different Team?

#### Consultants

Only if you know the problem you are trying to solve and if short-term training initiatives don't gain traction. See Domain Risk.


## Process

### Test The Process

Leverage "doing" as an opportunity to observe failure - and to learn. Section your system. DOCUMENT FIRST.

## Technology

### Domain Knowlege

#### Is This A Risk?

Depends on your cloud migration strategy. Are you net-newing based on a Product organization that has a clear, written definition of the behaviors the business needs to support? Or are you discovering this as you go? Or are you "lifting-and-shifting" your way to the cloud.

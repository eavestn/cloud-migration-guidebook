# The Cloud Migration Playbook

So, you want to migrate your legacy, on-premises services to the cloud? Cloud migrations ("digital transformations") have a reputation - and, largely, it isn't positive. However, your experience doesn't have to be. This playbook covers getting to the cloud. The people. The process. And the technology.

## Introduction

### To Cloud or Not To Cloud

#### Why You Need To Pay Attention

This (the history) isn't new, but in order to successfully produce software, you need to understand it.

#### The History

There's a fight in the mid-2020s; the reputation of the cloud is diminishing and a number of organizations are evaluating their infrastructural posture not having seen the gains they expected by moving off-premises and into "the cloud". Some go as far as to define this as the early stages of an exodus. My _feeling_? Like Marx wrote of the economies, the utopian future is the coming-to-rest of the cloud vs. on-premises predulum smack in the center. But, here's the thing: on-premises solutions are _cheaper_. Think about it, how many servers could you purchase for $50K a month - a real number that won't shock many technology leaders of cloud-based companies barely breaking $1M USD ARR (though it should, particularly as the spend is likely over-inflated by bad decisions in the magnitude of 10x)? 

There are always two costs to any project: the tools and the decision making of the people using those tools. That decision making - _the_ factor driving the short- and long-term costs of _your_ company - is informed by skills. Those skills are rooted in a person's training, a person's exposure, and a person's humanity. Futher layer into this _problem_ the fact that most leaders don't understand that there is only one way to solve any given problem that drives real success. Anything that isn't that solution will slow down productivity, drive down efficiency, and explode any semblence of predictability. _All_ of this will cost you money, and likely your business.

There are inescapable truths about Software. The worst? [Every system will fail to meet needs and will become progressively worse over time](https://medium.com/@eavestn/the-common-life-of-source-code-4c6aba1250fb). Why? People believe they can out perform the very physics of software. 

Never trust the arrogance that assumes manufacturing - at scale - the little silver trash can in my bathroom is harder than manufacturing software. People _pretend_ software is different. Why? Software is maleable, quickly modifiable. The perception is that software - as we way in climbing - has a lower commitment grade than manufacturing a trash can. 

[_Enter stage right the problem of the Customer._]

We learned something else dangerous in software. There's infinite cash on the table. If your software can do exactly what your user needs, then that cash is yours. And - theoretically - the more your software does of what's needed, the more needed your software becomes (look at the famous example of Salesforce). Unfortunately, Waterfall taught us that if you wait too long to get your understanding of your customers' needs in front of them, the greater the chance your customers' needs will have changed. The belief is that the faster you get your product in front of the customers, the faster you can understand if the product meets the customers needs and get the ever-needed, gold-encrusted feedback. 

Your product sucks? No problem. You'll just change it.

[_Enter stage left the problem of the Agile "Movement"_.]

A few years ago, some dudes (2001) figured out that you could get your product to the customer and learn more about your product if you got [rid of some rules that were perceived to undermine success](https://agilemanifesto.org/) (success here meaning "making money"). They figured out

> ... [I]f you wait too long to get your understanding of your customers' needs in front of them, the greater the chance your customers' needs will have changed.

But, like, they didn't do anything big, all they wrote was: 

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

The problem was that people ran with wreckless abandon to the edge of the cliff of this freedom and jumped straight off. The point was missed and quickly everything became excessively over-regimented. Certificate-issuing organizations started introducing frameworks that sought to structure this new way of working and guarantee results; however, those frameworks became so poorly adopted and misused - and then made even more complex - that they didn't work [INSERT C1 Article]. Worse? Those frameworks forgot about the very reason they existed. To focus time on doing well-defined work in a way that was not over-encumbered by process. 

#### Focus


## People

### The Culture That Produced The Problem Is Liable To Repeat The Failure

### Education

Should I train my people?  

#### Short-term Education Strategy

Beneficial in the short tem. Consult "Should I hire a different team?"

## Hiring

### Should I Hire A Different Team?

#### Consultants

Only if you know the problem you are trying to solve and if short-term training initiatives don't gain traction. See Domain Risk.


## Process

### Every Process Should Have A Documented Outcome

### Test The Process

Leverage "doing" as an opportunity to observe failure - and to learn. Section your system. DOCUMENT FIRST.

### Compliance

## Technology

### Domain Knowlege

#### Is This A Risk?

Depends on your cloud migration strategy. Are you net-newing based on a Product organization that has a clear, written definition of the behaviors the business needs to support? Or are you discovering this as you go? Or are you "lifting-and-shifting" your way to the cloud.

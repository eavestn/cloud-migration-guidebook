# The Cloud Migration Playbook

So, you want to migrate your legacy, on-premises services to the cloud? Cloud migrations ("digital transformations") have a reputation - and, largely, it isn't positive. However, your experience doesn't have to be. This playbook covers getting to the cloud. The people. The process. And the technology.

## Introduction

### To Cloud or Not To Cloud

There's a fight in the mid-2020s; the reputation of the cloud is diminishing and a number of organizations are evaluating their infrastructural posture not having seen the gains they expected by moving off-premises and into "the cloud". Some go as far as to define this as the early stages of an exodus. My _feeling_? Like Marx wrote of the economies, the utopian future is the coming-to-rest of the cloud vs. on-premises predulum smack in the center. But, here's the thing: on-premises solutions are _cheaper_. Think about it, how many servers could you purchase for $50K a month - a real number that won't shock many technology leaders of cloud-based companies barely breaking $1M USD ARR (though it should, particularly as the spend is likely over-inflated by bad decisions in the magnitude of 10x)? 

There are always two costs to any project: the tools and the decision making of the people using those tools. That decision making - _the_ factor driving the short- and long-term costs of _your_ company - is informed by skills. Those skills are rooted in a person's training, a person's exposure, and a person's humanity. Futher layer into this _problem_ the fact that most leaders don't understand that there is only one way to solve any given problem that drives real success. Anything that isn't that solution will slow down productivity, drive down efficiency, and explode any semblence of predictability. _All_ of this will cost you money, and likely your business.

There are inescapable truths about Software. The worst? [Every system will fail to meet needs and will become progressively worse over time](https://medium.com/@eavestn/the-common-life-of-source-code-4c6aba1250fb). Why? People believe they can out perform the very physics of software. 

Never trust the arrogance that assumes manufacturing - at scale - the little silver trash can in my bathroom is harder than manufacturing software. People _pretend_ software is different. Why? Software is maleable, quickly modifiable. The perception is that software - as we way in climbing - has a lower commitment grade than manufacturing a trash can.

## People

### The Culture That Produced The Problem Is Liable To Repeat The Failure

### Education

Should I train my people?  

#### Short-term Education Strategy

Beneficial in the short tem. Consult "Should I hire a different team?"

## Hiring

### Should I Hire A Different Team?

#### Consultants

Only if you know the problem you are trying to solve and if short-term training initiatives don't gain traction. See Domain Risk.


## Process

### Every Process Should Have A Documented Outcome

### Test The Process

Leverage "doing" as an opportunity to observe failure - and to learn. Section your system. DOCUMENT FIRST.

### Compliance

## Technology

### Domain Knowlege

#### Is This A Risk?

Depends on your cloud migration strategy. Are you net-newing based on a Product organization that has a clear, written definition of the behaviors the business needs to support? Or are you discovering this as you go? Or are you "lifting-and-shifting" your way to the cloud.
